### Sample Project

__CASE:__ 

An e-marketing entrepreneur used specialized software to track customer ordering activity.
That software provided only basic descriptive analysis of the data.

__APPROACH:__ 

I cleaned and explored the data set, and I considered how different variables related to one another. To quantify those relationships, I computed Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (R) for different variable pairs. This provided a more-coherent view of the client's business performance. 

__RESULT:__ 

By referring to the **R** values, the client could easily evaluate the effectiveness of the client's e-marketing program across different measures. 

**The graphs below represent some of the analyses I performed.**[^1]

| **A:** Boxplot. Shows the spread of the data. | 
| **B-D:** Scatter plots with ordinary least squares trendlines. |

The *R* values (noted above the scatter plots) represent the strength of association between the variable pairs. The maximum possible *R* value is **1**: a perfect positive correlation. 

__INTERPRETATION:__ 

Historic customer lifetime value is not strongly correlated with number of days active. 
Historic number of orders is not strongly correlated with number of days active.

### Other Projects

I have data analysis/machine learning notebooks posted on Kaggle that draw on publicly availabe datasets. These notebooks show the full sequence of steps I employ to clean, prepare, and analyze data.
