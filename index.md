### Sample project

__CASE:__ An e-marketing entrepreneur used specialized software to track customer ordering activity.
That software provided only basic descriptive analysis of the data.

I computed Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (R) for different variable pairs. This enabled the client to easily evaluate the effectiveness of the client's e-marketing program across different measures. The graphs below represent some of the analyses I performed.
