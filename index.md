### Real-world Work Sample

__CASE:__ 

An e-marketing entrepreneur used specialized software to track customer ordering activity.
That software provided only basic descriptive analysis of the data. 
The e-marketer wanted a customized analysis that would unlock additional insights.

__APPROACH:__ 

I cleaned and explored the data set, and I considered how different variables related to one another. To quantify those relationships, I computed Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (R) for different variable pairs.

__RESULT:__ 

The correlation values enabled the client to evaluate the performance of his e-marketing strategy across different dimensions. 

**The graphs below represent some of the analyses I performed for this client.**[^1]

| **A:** Boxplot. Shows the spread of the data. | 
| **B-D:** Scatter plots with ordinary least squares trendlines. |

The *R* values (noted above the scatter plots) represent the strength of association between the variable pairs. The maximum possible *R* value is **1**: a perfect positive correlation. 

__INTERPRETATION:__ 

Historic customer lifetime value is not strongly correlated with number of days active. 

Historic number of orders is not strongly correlated with number of days active.

### Other Projects

I have data analysis/machine learning notebooks posted on Kaggle that draw on publicly availabe datasets. These notebooks show the full sequence of steps I employ to clean, prepare, and analyze data.
