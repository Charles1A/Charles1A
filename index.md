#### Animated scatter plot showing changes in Nasdaq 100 stock returns (*y*) and standard deviations (*x*) over four quarters.

The figure below is a screengrab. A movie capture of the animation along with written commentary are available in a [post I wrote on LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/charles-ashton-ms_python-dataanalysis-stocks-activity-7049775343758413824-svK2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) (Code available [here](/animated_scatter_plot/Ndaq-100-animtd-scatter.ipynb).) The plot demonstrates how one can leverage Python-based tools to present time series data concisely.

#### Kaggle Data Projects

I have data analysis and machine learning notebooks on Kaggle that draw on publicly availabe datasets. These notebooks show the full sequence of steps I employ to clean, prepare, and analyze data. The figure below is from a notebook demonstrating the use of summary statistics, word clouds, the Shapiro-Wilk test for normality, logistic regression, and Boolean data filtering methods.
