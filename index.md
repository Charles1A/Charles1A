### Sample project

__CASE:__ An e-marketing entrepreneur used specialized software to track customer ordering activity.
That software provided only basic descriptive analysis of the data.

__APPROACH:__ I computed Pearson's Correlation Coefficient (R) for different variable pairs. 

__RESULT:__ This enabled the client to easily evaluate the effectiveness of the client's e-marketing program across different measures. 

**The graphs below represent some of the analyses I performed.**

| A: Boxplot. Shows the spread of the data. | 
| B-D: Scatter plots with ordinary least squares trendlines. |

__INTERPRETATION:__ The *R* values (noted above the scatter plots) represent the strength of association between the variable pairs. The maximum possible *R* value is **1**: a perfect positive correlation. 
- Historic customer lifetime value is not strongly correlated with number of days active. 
- Historic number of orders is not strongly correlated with number of days active.
