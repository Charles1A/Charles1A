#### Airbnb dataset analysis: amenities vs price

The figures below show a word cloud of listed amenities and a correlation study of price versus number of amenities. I present additional analyses along with a complete walk-through of my data cleaning and analysis steps in this notebook: [Airbnb In-depth Data Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/code/charlesea/in-depth-exploratory-data-analysis-airbnb)

#### Animated scatter plot showing changes in Nasdaq 100 stock returns (*y*) and volatility (*x*) over four quarters.

The figure below is a screengrab. A movie capture of the animation along with written commentary are available in a [post I wrote on LinkedIn.](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/charles-ashton-ms_python-dataanalysis-stocks-activity-7049775343758413824-svK2?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop) (Code available [here](https://github.com/Charles1A/Nasdaq100_animated_scatter_plot).) The plot demonstrates how one can leverage Python-based tools to present time series data concisely.
